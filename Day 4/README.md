What this program covers:
-------------------------

- Greet the player and ask them for the input.
- A random number is generated by the system.
- A loop is created where the user guesses the number. (Validate the input using a try-except block.)
- Compare the user input with the randomly generated number.
- Provide the user hints if they were unable to guess the number.
- Congratualte the user for guessing the number and thus, the game ends.
