What this program covers:
-------------------------

- The provided code defines a class CustomerSegmentation, which is intended to manage and categorize customers based on their membership level. 
- The membership levels are represented by three classes: Customer (standard), GoldCustomer, and PlatinumCustomer. Each customer has a name, age, and gender, and Gold and Platinum customers have additional attributes like a spending limit and a perk (e.g., free shipping for Platinum customers).
- The concepts I wanted to cover were:
    a) Class creation
    b) Object creation
    c) Inheritance
    d) Polymorphism
    e) Encapsulation
    f) Constructors
