What this program covers:
-------------------------

- This program is a simple implementation of a 2-player Pong game using the Pygame library.
- Set up the game window with a specified width and height.
- Create paddles, a ball, and sets initial positions and speeds.
- Run the main game loop, where the game logic and rendering take place.
- Handle events, such as quitting the game when the close button is clicked.
- Allow the right paddle to be controlled by the user using the UP and DOWN arrow keys.
- Implement a simple AI-like logic for the left paddle to automatically track the ball's vertical position.
- Check for collisions between the ball and the paddles.
- Reflect the ball's direction when it hits a paddle.
- Monitor the ball's position to detect when it crosses the left or right boundary.
- Reset the ball's position and speed when it crosses a boundary, simulating scoring.
- Use Pygame's clock to control the frame rate, ensuring smoother animation.
- Quit the game and exit Pygame when the main loop is terminated.
- Import necessary modules (pygame and random).
- Define color constants (BLACK and WHITE).
