What this program covers:
-------------------------

- Take an input value from the player. (Validate the input provided.)
- Import the random function to make the computer choose a pseudorandom value.
- Use an else-if ladder to determine who the winner is and display the suitable output.
- Use a while loop to play multiple rounds of the game.
- Avoid using string comparisons as much as possible as it could cause confusion. Hence, assign the possible actions ("Rock", "Paper", "Scissors") to number values.
- Optimize the code by creating functions for each step of the game.
