What this program covers:
-------------------------

- These exercises were collected by me from various platforms to practice them in python. 
- Question 1:
Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generate a list and a tuple which contains every number.Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

34,67,55,33,12,98
Then, the output should be:

['34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98']
('34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98')
- Question 2:
Define a class which has at least two methods:

getString: to get a string from console input
printString: to print the string in upper case.
Also please include simple test function to test the class methods.
- Question 3:
Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array. The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i _ j.*

Note: i=0,1.., X-1; j=0,1,¡­Y-1. Suppose the following inputs are given to the program: 3,5

Then, the output of the program should be:

[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]]
- Question 4:
Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

without,hello,bag,world
Then, the output should be:

bag,hello,without,world
- Question 5:
Write a program that accepts sequence of lines as input and prints the lines after making all characters in the sentence capitalized.

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

Hello world
Practice makes perfect
Then, the output should be:

HELLO WORLD
PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT
